# like-for-like-app

Description
Like for Like is a personal project made with Node.js, Express.js, plain JS and MongoDB. After you log in with OAuth 2, you can browse YouTube Videos other people have posted on the site to like. With each video you like, you earn points, with which you can reward other people to like your videos. The liking functionality was made with the YouTube Data API v3.

Running the app:
In the project directory, run the app with node by using "node index.js". You will have to connect to a MongoDB Database to be able to log in, post and view videos etc. You will also need a "credentials.json" file with the proper redirect URI in the project directory for OAuth 2 to work.
